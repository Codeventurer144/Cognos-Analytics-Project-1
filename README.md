# Cognos-Analytics-Project-1
Analyzing and visualizing a Customer Loyalty Program Data Module Using IBM Cognos Analytics
In this project, I used the skills I gained from IBM Skills Network to analyze and visualize large data in a CSV file containing a business's sales and customers' data amongst other related data in columns such as 'Revenue', 'LoyaltyStatus' (of customers), 'Location Code '(for the location of customers) and so on. The project starts with a simple visualization of the performance of different products of the company from 2016 to 2020, as well as the total quantities sold and the total revenue of that time range.
It finally delves into calculations, manipulation of data points within visualizations, applying top/bottom settings on visualizations, constructing navigation paths, and filtering data within a dashboard.
